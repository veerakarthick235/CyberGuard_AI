## CyberGuard AI - The Adaptive Phishing Simulator 🛡️

CyberGuard AI is an interactive web application that uses AI to teach users how to identify and defend against realistic phishing attacks in a safe, simulated environment.

## The Problem
Standard cybersecurity training is often passive and fails to prepare people for the sophisticated, personalized phishing emails they face today. This project turns passive learning into an active, gamified experience to make people genuinely better at spotting cyber threats.

## Key Features
🤖 AI-Powered Threat Generation: Uses the Google Gemini API to create unique and convincing phishing emails in real-time, moving beyond a fixed list of examples.

🧠 Adaptive Difficulty: The AI automatically generates more challenging emails as the user's score increases, ensuring a continuous learning curve.

🎓 Instant AI Tutor Feedback: After a user decides if an email is safe or a phish, the AI provides immediate, detailed feedback, explaining the specific red flags.

🏷️ Attack Categorization: Each phishing attempt is categorized by the AI (e.g., "Urgency Scam," "Credential Harvesting"), adding another layer of educational value.

🏆 Scoring System: Gamifies the learning process by awarding points for correct answers and deducting for mistakes.

✨ Futuristic Animated UI: A modern, dark-themed interface with animations and a glowing aesthetic to make the experience more engaging.

## Tech Stack
Backend: Python with the Flask framework.

Frontend: Standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

Artificial Intelligence: Google Gemini API for generating and analyzing content.
